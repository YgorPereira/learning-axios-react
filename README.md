# Axios with React Learning üöÄ

In this project, I developed a simple React.js application with the goal of learning how to use Axios to fetch data from third-party APIs or my own backend. For this purpose, I consumed data from the [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) API and displayed it in basic frontend pages. This skill is essential for modern frontend development.



## Running ‚öôÔ∏è

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/YgorPereira/learning-axios-react.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
  cd learning-axios-react
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Inicie o servidor

```bash
  npm run dev
```


## what I learned? ü§ì

In this project, I enhanced my frontend development skills by integrating Axios to handle HTTP requests with a third-party REST API, gaining a deeper understanding of endpoints and base URL configuration. I also explored client-side routing in React using react-router-dom, implementing dynamic navigation between views through route-based URL structures. Additionally, I analyzed and adopted the modular project structure scaffolded by Vite, which improved my understanding of modern React project setup and build optimization.
